				<h3>The Oculus Rift</h3>
				<p>Technology has been developed to a point where it is capable of deceiving the human brain by a substantial amount. The Oculus Rift is something that does just that. 
					
					<p>Take for example, a game that involves characters jumping out of an airplane. No matter how great the graphics or the animations are, the jump won’t give the user that genuine feeling of falling from the sky. 2D/3D technology fails at that because 
					of our peripheral vision. Our brains can see on the screen that we are indeed falling, but our peripheral vision suggests to us that we are not (because everything else around the screen is stationary). With the Oculus Rift, and with the right animator, 
					the whole 3D experience will be a thing of the past and will be a story that we will tell our grandchildren in the future. 
					
					<p>Enough of the chit-chat though, let’s get down to business. You now may be thinking, “how does the Oculus Rift work and where can I get one?”. 				

					<p>The Oculus Rift works its magic by covering our peripheral vision with a display screen that dynamically moves according with our movements. Couple together with other gear such as a treadmill, it is very possible to deeply immerse a person into the virtual reality!/n/n

					<p>The Oculus Rift is still in its early stages, but it is definitely usable and available for purchase for an affordable price of $350.

				<h3>Driverless Cars by Google</h3>
				<p>
					They say that technology has made our generation of people the laziest of all generations. Google’s Driverless Cars don’t really help our argument against that saying. Nonetheless, it’s still an awesome invention by Google!<br>

					The Driverless Cars are capable of driving extremely safely and have skills that resemble us at the same time. In fact, the algorithms are so on-point that technically there have been 0 accidents that are responsible by these cars! <br>

					The possibilities that can be derived from this concept are endless. Imagine being able to send your car to any location you want and then back? No more picking up family members after work! Want to take a nap on the way to work? No problems! 
					However, nothing comes without a price though. It would be very possible that many old technologies and jobs would be rendered obsolete after a breakthrough invention like this. In fact, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2841781/The-car-future-looks-like-living-room-Mercedes-unveils-driverless-car-concept-complete-coffee-table.html" target="_blank";>other</a>
					automotive companies out there are quickly catching on, and are starting to ride the bandwagon as well. <br><br>

					Keep your eyes peeled for these cars in the very near future!
